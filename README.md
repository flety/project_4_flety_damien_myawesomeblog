# myawesomeblog
This is my awesome blog. Pretty much empty but I don't know
what to write about.

## Build
To build my awesome blog you need to :
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then simply build the project using the generated makefile `make html`
this will build your blog in `output/` directory.

## CI/CD
Here how to build myawesome blog on Gitlab.

You need to have thooses secret set on your Gitlab instance :
- `GITHUB_USER_NAME` : Your username on Github
- `GITHUB_USER_MAIL` : Your email on Github
- `GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD` : Your Github password

Except that this is MY awesome blog so I don't provide the way
to deploy it elsewhere. And I won't give my logon ids to you !
Cheers.
